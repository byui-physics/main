 Computational materials research involves the use of computer
algorithms and simulations to make realistic predictions about the
properties and thermodynamic stability of materials.



## Education

## Research 
They serve a
critical role in the discover of high-performing materials which, in
turn, drives technological advancements.  Computational modeling
serves a key function in the discovery of batteries, solar cells,
integrated circuits, jet engines, and more.  The development proces
for new technologies

1. Computational scientist constructs a models for a promising alloy system.
2. The model is used to determine naturally-occuring crystal
   structures, including at non-zero temperatures.
3. The properties of the alloy are investigated.  Will this material
   outperform what we already have?
4. If results are promising, metallugist and/or experimentalist take
over and work to fabricate the material, confirming computational
results.
5. Engineers proceed to use the material in the design of new
technologies.
6.  You get better solar panels on your roof.


My hope is that this webpage will be a resource for students
interested in pursuing a career modeling.  Here you will find
resources for learning about the field as well as research projects
that you could work on in my group.

See the sidebar on the left for example projects that you could jump
in on.
