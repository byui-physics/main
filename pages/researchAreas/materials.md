## Overview

In the computational materials reseach group, we perform calculations
and simulations of real materials and search for new, high-performing
candidates.  Below you will find some helpful links and instructions
for getting started.  

## Getting setup on Mary Lou

###  Navigating from the command line
In order to effectively use the supercomputer (or any computer I might
argue) you have to get good working at the command line.  There are
many tutorials out there that will help you get started.  Below I
provide some links to some:

### Setting up your filesystem on Mary Lou
There are a few things you need to do once you get a supercomputing
account before you are ready to get to work
1- Create a `bin` folder
``` bash
mkdir ~/bin
```
2- Create and modify a `.bash_profile`
``` bash
emacs ~/.bash_profile
```
