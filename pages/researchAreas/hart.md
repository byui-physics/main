The High Altitude Research Team (or HART) Balloon team launches high altitude research balloons to the edge of space, carrying a payload of data sensors, then chase it down over adventurous terrains to recover the instruments and analyze the data. If youâ€™re looking for some great hands-on professional experience to pad your resume, 
or just looking for something fun to do on the weekends, this is the place for you.
